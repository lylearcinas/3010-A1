## Why multicast makes sense
Multicast makes sense for this application as we need to send the results of our work to multiple locations. If we did not use a multicast server, only one active connection would be able to see updates that our worker provides. If this were a real application doing real work, this might be multiple machines that need to know exactly when, say, an image file is done being processed.

Multicast also makes sense because we talked about it during class and when else are we going to bring it up?
